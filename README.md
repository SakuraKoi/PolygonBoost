## FAQ
> The DeFi website you are visiting stopped working after used the extension?

Try to use another node, That's not my fault but the node you're using not compatible with the website you're visiting
> It not works and the website is still using old node?

This may be because you are visiting a site that uses a node that we do not yet support, You can manully add it to node list.\
How To:
1. Press F12 to open Developer Tools, switch to Network
2. Find the Matic node used by the site, which is usually spamming in the request list
3. Open our extension, paste the URL of the node into the edit box at the top, and click Add
4. Done
